# Essential YouTube

_Essential YouTube is an experiment to improve user experience by stripping the redundant away and focusing on the essentials._

## Features
* __Disruption-free Search__
  
  The video keeps playing even while you are searching. 
* __Instant Search__

  See the results as you are typing. 
* __Queuing__

  Queue videos as you like to watch them consecutively. 
* __Looping__

  Loop a video forever. 
* __Hassle-free__

  Video annotations are disabled by default. Also, no Autoplay, but the videos you want to play. 
* __Client-side__

  There are no servers in-between you and YouTube; everything is done on your computer and it's open source. As private as it could be. 

Obvious it might sound, but please keep in mind that Essential YouTube is an experiment, and as pleasing as it might be to use, it's not intended to be a replacement for everyday use. Missing functionality is not a bug, it's a feature.
